    <h2>About The Author</h2>
    <p id="about the author">(Via Wikipedia) Khaled Hosseini (Persian: خالد حسینی‎‎ [ˈxɒled hoˈsejni]; /ˈhɑːlɛd hoʊˈseɪni/; born March 4, 1965) is an Afghan-born American novelist and physician.[1][2] After graduating from college, he worked as a doctor in California, an occupation that he likened to "an arranged marriage."[3] He has published three novels, most notably his 2003 debut The Kite Runner, all of which are at least partially set in Afghanistan and feature an Afghan as the protagonist. Following the success of The Kite Runner he retired from medicine to write full-time.</p>

    <h2>Critical Acclaim</h2>
    <p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview15">The Guardian, 2003</a>
    <br>War and the trauma of the Taliban have made Afghanistan an unlikely setting for literary fiction, and have given its writers little opportunity to be heard in the west. California-based Khaled Hosseini's first novel is an attempt to correct this, and to remind us of the anonymity it enjoyed before the Soviet invasion in 1979.
	    <br>
	    The nucleus of The Kite Runner is strong. Amir, the motherless only child of the widely loved Baba, has grown up with Hassan, a member of the abused Hazara minority who is both his servant and his best friend. In a moment of cowardice, however, Amir betrays his companion, leaving him in the hands of a violent bully who rapes him. After this, the very sight of Hassan becomes painful to Amir, and he betrays him once again, forcing the boy and his crippled father from the family home.
	    <br>
	    Hosseini conjures the awful feeling of guilt that childhood wrongdoing can induce, the fear that one is forever branded as the result of one's actions.</p>
